## 🧩 Real-World Problem

Bioinformatics research labs often manage a mix of Slurm-based HPC systems and ad-hoc container clusters. This hybrid approach leads to:

- **Configuration Drift:** Inconsistent environments across different systems.
- **Poor Reproducibility:** Challenges in replicating computational experiments.
- **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Difficulty in scaling and managing resources effectively.

---

## 🔍 Existing Solutions

### 1. **Slurm-Based HPC Systems**

- **Description:** Traditional high-performance computing clusters using Slurm for job scheduling.
- **Pros:**
  - Optimized for batch processing.
  - Widely adopted in academic and research institutions.
- **Cons:**
  - Limited support for containerization.
  - Complex configuration and maintenance.

### 2. **Ad-Hoc Kubernetes Clusters**

- **Description:** Manually configured Kubernetes clusters tailored for specific projects.
- **Pros:**
  - Flexibility in deployment.
  - Leverages container orchestration benefits.
- **Cons:**
  - Prone to configuration drift.
  - Lack of standardization across environments.

### 3. **Cloud-Based HPC Services**

- **Description:** Managed HPC solutions offered by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Pros:**
  - Scalability and on-demand resource provisioning.
  - Reduced infrastructure management overhead.
- **Cons:**
  - Higher operational costs.
  - Potential data compliance and security concerns.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

Implement a **GitOps-driven Kubernetes cluster** tailored for bioinformatics workflows, leveraging tools like Argo CD, Terraform, and Helm to ensure:

- **Declarative Infrastructure:** All configurations stored in Git for version control.
- **Continuous Reconciliation:** Automated syncing of cluster state with Git repositories.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources based on workload demands.
- **Reproducibility:** Standardized environments for consistent results.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Overview

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**

   - Utilize **Terraform** to provision AWS EKS clusters or on-premises RHEL-based Kubernetes clusters.
   - Define infrastructure as code for repeatable deployments.

2. **GitOps Implementation:**

   - Deploy **Argo CD** to manage Kubernetes manifests stored in Git repositories.
   - Set up automatic syncing to ensure cluster state matches the desired configuration.

3. **Application Deployment:**

   - Package bioinformatics tools like **Nextflow** and **Galaxy** using **Helm charts**.
   - Manage application versions and configurations declaratively.

4. **Security and Compliance:**

   - Implement **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** policies for governance.
   - Use **Sealed Secrets** to manage sensitive information securely.

5. **Observability:**
   - Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and visualization.
   - Set up alerts and dashboards to monitor cluster health and performance.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- **Tool Integration:** Ensuring seamless integration between Terraform, Argo CD, and Helm.
- **Security Management:** Handling sensitive data securely within GitOps workflows.
- **Resource Optimization:** Balancing performance with cost in cloud environments.
- **User Training:** Educating team members on GitOps principles and tool usage.
